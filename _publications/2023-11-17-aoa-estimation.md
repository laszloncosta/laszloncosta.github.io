There is provided techniques for angle of arrival estimation. A method is performed by a first transceiver device. The first transceiver device comprises a dual-polarization physical antenna array. The method comprises receiving a first reference signal from a second transceiver device. The method comprises estimating channel gains for each polarization of the dual-polarization physical antenna array. The method comprises receiving a second reference signal from the second transceiver device. The method comprises estimating the angle of arrival of the second reference signal from two measurements of the second reference signal and based on a cross-polarization ratio of channel components as estimated from the channel gains.
