<!-- Dynamic-time division duplex (TDD) networks have been considered as a promising solution to handle the asymmetry of traffic demand between downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) in dense networks. However, this solution creates a new kind of interference among base stations (BS-to-BS) and among user equipments (UE-to-UE), which is called cross-channel interference. This article presents some insights on how to deal with the cross-channel interference in dynamic-TDD systems. A new space division multiple access (SDMA) grouping problem is formulated in this work for dynamic-TDD scenarios, which aims at selecting the best set of user equipments (UEs) and is solved through low complexity greedy algorithms. Results are presented for zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming methods and SDMA grouping strategies for a given frequency resource. Some different trade-off parameters defined in the optimization problem are also analyzed, which have a different impact on the downlink and uplink capacity. -->
