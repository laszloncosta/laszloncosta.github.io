There is provided mechanisms for assisting a UE-side beam selection procedure. A method is performed by a network node. The method comprises estimating TRP-side angular information of a UE from uplink signalling received from the UE at a TRP of the network node. The method comprises reporting the TRP-side angular 5 information towards the UE and configuring the UE to perform a UE-side beam selection procedure based on the TRP-side angular information.
